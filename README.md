## Homeworks
**HW2** - In HW2, we calculated the quartiles of different data sets using both `NumPy` and with a self-written implementation

**HW3** - HW3's purpose is to provide practice for querying `DataFrames` using `Pandas`. Created functions to create a `DataFrame`, a function to return the number of outliers in a `DataFrame`, and a function to return the number of deviants in a `DataFrame`.

**HW4** - HW4 provided some practice with data manipulation using a dataset concerning the Coronavirus

**HW5** - HW5 introduced data visualization, and also introduced me to my complete distaste of matplotlib.
