**HW1** - In HW1, we calculated the quartiles of different data sets using both `NumPy` and with a self-written implementation

**HW2** - HW2's purpose is to provide practice for querying `DataFrames` using `Pandas`. Created functions to create a `DataFrame`, a function to return the number of outliers in a `DataFrame`, and a function to return the number of deviants in a `DataFrame`.
